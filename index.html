        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          As a coder, my passion lies in the ever-evolving world of technology and the endless possibilities it holds. My expertise in Python, PineScript, C++, C# and a number of web development frameworks is just the tip of the iceberg, as my true interest lies in the realm of machine learning and its potential to change the way we live and work. I firmly believe that open source projects are the backbone of technological progress and I am always eager to contribute to and learn from the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a problem solver at heart and I firmly believe that technology should be used to solve real-world problems. I am always on the lookout for new and challenging projects to work on, as they provide me with the opportunity to learn and grow as a coder. I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology, and I am always open to learning new programming languages and technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am confident that my skills, passion, and drive make me a valuable asset to any team or project. My portfolio is a window into my work and my journey as a coder. Thank you for visiting and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and bring your ideas to life.
